1) escape characters are backslash \ that precedes illegal character, \n, \r, \t. Example: s = "hello, \"world\""
2) \t makes whitespace in a string, example: print("Hello\tworld") will output "Hello world".
   \n inserts a new line in a string, print("Hello\nworld") will print "Hello" and "world" in two lines
3) To include backslash we should use double backslash \\
4) Single quote should not be escaped if string is surrounded by double quotes
5) \r makes new line as well
6) 'Hello, world'[1] = 'e'
   'Hello, world'[0:5] = 'Hello'
   'Hello, world'[:5] = 'Hello'
   'Hello, world'[3:] = 'lo, world'
7) 'Hello'.upper() = 'HELLO'
   'Hello'.upper().isupper() = True
   'Hello'.upper().lower() = 'hello'
8) The first expression outputs a list, containing all characters between whitespaces: ["Remember,", "remember", "the", "fifth", "of", "July"]
   The second expression outputs a string with "-" instead of whitespaces: 'There-can-only-one.'
