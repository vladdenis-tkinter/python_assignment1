1) operators are: *, +, /, -. These operators are indended for manipulation upon data values (numbers, strings). Values are: 6 - integer, -87.8 - negative float number, 
'hello' - string

2) String is enclosed either by "" or by ''. In this example 'spam' is a string located in some space in RAM. On the other hand spam is the name of variable 
which points in some space in memory where any data is stored (integer, string and so on)

3) numbers, strings, boolean

4) expression consists of operators (for example *) and operands (variables upon which operands work). The function of expression is to calculate a variable

5) declaration initialize variable by some value for the first time, expression works upon this value and can change it

6) bacon remains the same 22

7) We can add strings to one another and multiply string by integer, so both terms will be 'spamspamspam'

8) Variable name should start with letter (or underscore), not a number, so 100 is invalid variable name

9) float(x) converts value to floating-point number, int(x) - to integer, str(x) - to string

10) The error is about trying to concatenate string and int, firstly we should transform int to string: 'i have eaten ' + str(99) + 'burritos.'
