1) [] is a list creating
2) spam.insert(3, "hello")
3) it`s the value of third element (33 / 11 == 3), 'd'
4) spam[-1] gives the last element, 'd'
5) spam[:2] outputs elements form start till the second one, ['a', 'b']
6) bacon.index('cat') == 1 (only the first appearence)
7) [3.14, 'cat' ,11, 'cat', True, 99]
8) only the first 'cat' will be removed from the list
9) list1 + list2 concatenates values of both lists, 
   list2 = list1 * 2 replicates list1 two times and assigns final list to variable list2
10) append() adds value after the last element of the list, while insert(n, x) adds element x at the n-th postition (not necessary the last position)
11) remove() - to delete some specific item, pop() - to return and delete the last item
12) string is a list of characters, so we can iterate over string just like over list:
     for x in list:
         print(x)       //prints 'x' element of the list
     for x in string:
         print (x)      //prints 'x' character of the string
13) tuples are immutable, means that values can not be changed after assignment, while in list we can change values in any time
14) t = (42, ). Comma is necessary in case of 1 element in tuple
15) list = [1,2,3]. 
    t = tuple(list) - this is a tuple containing list values.
    
    t = (1,2,3)
    list = [x for x in t] - list containig tuple values
16) These variables can be tuples and sets containig any type of variables including lists. In dictionary list can only be a value, not a key
17) copy() method copies only first-level variables, while deepcopy() makes copy of all nested objects if any
