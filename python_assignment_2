1) Boolean types are True and False. Behind the scene True has integer value 1 and False has value 0

2) Boolean operators are: AND, OR, !

3) x | y | AND (has value True if all variables are True)
   0 | 0 | 0
   1 | 0 | 0
   0 | 1 | 0
   1 | 1 | 1
   
   x | y | OR (has value True if one or more variables is True)
   0 | 0 | 0
   1 | 0 | 1
   0 | 1 | 1
   1 | 1 | 1
   
   x | ! (invert the value of variable)
   1 | 0
   0 | 1
   
   4) (5 > 4) AND (3 == 5) = False
      not (5 > 4) = False
      (5 > 4) OR (3 == 5) = True
      not ((5 > 4) OR (3 == 5)) = False
      (True AND True) AND (True == False) = False
      (not False) or (not True) = True
      
  5)
  
  6) 'equal to' measures if two variables are identical and is typed as '=='. Assignment operator is '=' and assign some value to variable
  
  7) condition construction is used when we should do something in case of some condition, for example
      if (5 > 4):
         print '5 > 4'
  
  8) spam = 0 is assignment operator
